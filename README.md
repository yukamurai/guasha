"## Gua Sha Search Trend in the U.S. in 2020" 

Many of you probably had never heard of Gua Sha prior to 2020. It's an ancient Chinese healing technique that many social media users in the skincare community discovered and ventured out for a new self-care routine last year.

I was simply curious when and how the concept of Gua Sha and its iconic rose quartz Gua Sha stones all suddenly became so popular in the skincare landscape, so I took a couple of time series data from Google Search Trends in the U.S. to see how this trend started. To give a perspective I've added a facial roller trend to pair up and compare side by side with the Gua Sha trend. (I included 'face roller' as well because some people search 'face roller' instead of 'facial roller'.)

The graph shows clearly that a rapid increase in the search trend started right before April. I assume this correlates to the first round of pandemic shutdown that happened in March when people began spending most of their time at home, allowing them to have extra time for self-care. (And thanks to all the YouTube and Tiktok tutorial posts demonstrating how to glide the Gua Sha down on skin.) The volume of search quickly went down in May when the lockdown was lifted at most places. It stayed low throughout the summer. As the holiday seasons approached, the search volume started to climb back up. The gift shopping season was around the corner, and more people were back spending more time at home as the COVID case number began to climb again.
